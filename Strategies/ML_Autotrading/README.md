# Automated Trading with Machine Learning

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms to develop an automated trading strategy. Using historical market data, the strategy predicts market movements to make trading decisions in real-time.

## Overview

`autotrading_ML.ipynb` is a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that outlines the process of designing, testing, and implementing a machine learning-based trading strategy. It includes data preprocessing, model training, risk management, and strategy automation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques for cleaning and preparing market data for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Building and training machine learning models to predict market trends.
- **Risk Management**: Analyzing potential risks and implementing strategies to mitigate losses.
- **Strategy Automation**: Code for automating trade execution based on model predictions.
